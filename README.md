# cattale

This is a project documentation repository for sumkittehz.

## Statement of Principals ##

This development effort is primarily in pursuit of Privacy.

The issues of Privacy are perhaps related to or intertwined with issues in the realm of Anonymity and Security.  So to be clear:  We are building on the Tails and Tor heritage, this project will establish an identity that provides levels of privacy suitable for uses which may be impeded by the use of perfect anonymity.

So the ``cattale`` project specifies the Class Object Tails "_for cats_" as opposed to, say, "_dog tails_" or "_horse tails_".

One could also think of this as sort of 

```
  kitteh => Cat<Tor>;
  cattale :=  Tails<kitteh>
```

construct, as well.

**Note:  If you find this offensively specist, then**
  a) ***you are missing the point,*** and
  b) ***let us know now so we can prepare the legal defense.***

The documentation in this repository docuemts our customizations 
of the The Amnesiac Incognito Live System ("Tails") as a turn-key
ersonal kiosk portal.

We are creating on a custom profile specific to the ``dotfiles`` mechanism in Tails.  This profile will be tailored to create network  identity while reseerve the right to privacy for personally indentifiable information specific to individual users. User control of personal information is non-negotiable, here.

Customizations will include pre-installed keys, configurations, 
applications specific to the darkcloudops designplan.
